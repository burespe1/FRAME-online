FRAME NEXT is a project that extends the European ITS Framework Architecture, now normally known as the FRAME Architecture, with the activities of the different member states in Europe, within the priority areas of the ITS directive (Directive 2010/40/EU) and with the methodologies and tools that make a modern ITS architecture attractive and appealing for its users.

The result of the project will be an ITS environment for Europe which emphasizes conditions for system interoperability and supports transport policy goals of seamless multimodal mobility, enhanced road safety and lower emissions. In order to take into account current developments this environment will be able to change and adapt to the respective needs.

Changing partnerships along the ITS value chain are needed to deliver new services and applications to end-users as well as to public and private organisations. FRAME NEXT will contribute to a facilitated establishment of new cooperations.

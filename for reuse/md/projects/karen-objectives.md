# OBJECTIVES

The prime objective of the FRAME projects is to co-ordinate and
promote the wide-scale implementation of ITS in Europe through the deployment of
the European ITS Framework Architecture.
FRAME-NET will provide a focal point for confrontation and co-ordination of ITS
architecture-related activities in the whole of Europe.

The Framework Architecture was developed by the KAREN project
in response to the need for a single reference platform in Europe which would
provide a basis for the development of ITS products and services. A number of
national authorities have since started to develop their own national ITS
framework architectures, and are adapting KAREN to their own needs. In
implementing the Framework, individual countries and users will tend to adopt
their own priorities and make their own decisions on investment. In this context,
FRAME-NET plays an important role in providing technical guidance, and overall
co-ordination to ensure coherence at the European level. The network will also
help maintain the momentum previously created and encourage wider use of the
Framework Architecture.

The intention is that through the activities of FRAME-NET,
all those involved in ITS architecture-related activities will interact with
each other to exchange knowledge and exploit accumulated experience. This will
enable solutions to be found and a common approach adopted. The Thematic Network
will help to achieve this objective by co-ordinating on-going activities
concerning the Framework, and by providing a forum for dissemination and
concertation. The Network will also serve as a democratic means for the member
states to protect the stability of the European ITS Framework Architecture.

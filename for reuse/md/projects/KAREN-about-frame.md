## The FRAME projects

The FRAME projects (FRamework 
Architecture 
Made for 
Europe) 
were funded by the European Commission as part of the 5th Framework Programme of 
the Information Society 
Technologies (IST) Directorate. They were a follow-on to the KAREN project 
(1998-2000) which developed the first version of the European ITS Framework Architecture.

The aim of the two closely 
linked projects FRAME-NET 
and FRAME-S 
(2001-2004) was to promote the use of the Framework Architecture, to give support to users and 
to make any necessary updates and improvements to the Architecture.

For a full list of those involved in 
            the two projects see the PARTICIPANTS 
page.

All reports and other 
material produced by these projects can be downloaded from the
LIBRARY page.

* FRAME-NET 
    (July 2001-Sept 2004) was a 'Thematic Network' whose 
    role was to 
    provide information about the European ITS Architecture and promote opportunities for those involved in
architecture-related activities in Europe to exchange their experience.
    
    This was achieved through:
    - publication of brochures, leaflets, etc.Â 
    - organisation of international meetings and workshops
    - management of the FRAME Website.
    
    Contact was also maintained 
with non European countries. During events such as the World ITS Congresses, workshops 
    were organised in order to promote discussion of architecture-related topics of 
international interest.
Â 
    FRAME-NET set up several Work Groups which 
    examined various 
    aspects of the Framework Architecture and support activities in order to make recommendations for 
    improvements.
Â  
    The project was led by Jan Willem Tierolf of RWS-AVV (Netherlands DOT);  
    other main partners are ERTICO (Belgium) and MIZAR Automazione (Italy). They 
    were 
    assisted by a group of project members representing the main national 
    architecture initiatives in Europe (see below).
* FRAME-S
    (Aug 2001-Oct 2004) was an 'Accompanying Measure' responsible for 
    the following activities:
    -Â  updates to the European ITS Framework Architecture
    -Â  creation and running of training seminars and workshops
    -Â  Help Desk for technical assistance for architecture developersÂ 
    -Â  development of Navigation Tools 
    for the Framework Architecture
Â 
    
    FRAME-S was led by Richard Bossom of Siemens Traffic Controls (UK); Peter Jesty 
    was responsible for 
    training activities. They were supported 
    by seven partners with expertise in ITS architectures (listed below).
    
    Among the major achievements of FRAME-S
    - issue of a series of Architecture updates (culminating in Version 3.0)
    - development of the Browsing Tool 
    - development of the Selection Tool
    - issue of a Configuration Guide for national ITS architecture developers
    - creation of training seminar and workshop programmes
    - holding of numerous training sessions throughout Europe

### Work Groups

### The FRAME-NET Work Groups consisted of FRAME 
            Project partners and representatives of the major national ITS 
            architecture initiatives in Europe. They were led by MIZAR 
            Automazione. Each group prepared a final report (see below).

* MULTIMODALITYÂ (Final report - D3.1 - Oct 2002)
              examining the need and possibility of extending the Framework 
              Architecture to cover intermodal and multimodal functions. The 
              report concludes that although a full European multimodal architecture is not 
              feasible, key interfaces should be developed and the 
              relevant 'User Needs' included in the Framework Architecture.
* NATIONAL ARCHITECTURE 
              VALIDATION
              Â (Final report - 
              D3.2 - Feb 2004)
              assessment of the 'usability' and 'usefulness' of the Framework 
              Architecture and the support provided by the FRAME projects 
              from the point of view of national architecture initiatives. A 
              inventory was also compiled of the current status of national ITS architectures.
* VALIDATION OF NAVIGATION TOOL 
              (Final report - D3.3 - Nov 2004)
              an examination of the requirements and options for the Browsing 
              and Selection Tools developed by FRAME-S to facilitate use of the Framework Architecture.Â  The 
              group carried out 
              tests on the prototype tools and gave feedback to the FRAME-S project.
* IMPACT ANALYSIS 
              (Final report - D3.4 Dec 2003)
              an evaluation of the advantages and risks of using the Framework 
              Architecture, with a first attempt to make a quantified analysis 
              of the costs and benefits.
              
              The above reports can be downloaded from the 
              LIBRARY page.

### Participants

For full list of all those involved as FRAME partners, members and 
associates see PARTICIPANTS

The support of the FRAME projects extended 
to all EU Member States, including the new Accession countries. Technical assistance 
was offered free of charge to those working on the development of national ITS 
architectures.

The activities of the network were open to 
anyone interested in knowing more about ITS architectures, in particular those 
working for:

- national, regional and city transport authorities 
- public transport and freight fleet operators
- transport information service providers 
- manufacturers of ITS products and services

FRAME PROJECT CONSORTIUM

The Consortium consists of representatives of the national ministries of the 
main European countries currently developing national architectures, plus a 
number of organisations closely involved in ITS architecture work.

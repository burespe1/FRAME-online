# OBJECTIVES

The aim of the European
Framework Architecture is to provide a single reference platform for the development of ITS products and
services in Europe. The prime objective of the FRAME projects is to promote the
implementation and enhancement of the Framework Architecture.

There are currently two
closely related projects:

* FRAME-NET
    is a Thematic Network
    whose aim is to provide the opportunity for all
    those involved in
architecture-related activities in Europe to exchange experience and information.
    This will be done through:
    - a series of workshops (each on specific topics)Â 
    - "Cluster Meetings" open to all interested organisations
    - this Website, as an interactive forum
* FRAME-S
    is responsible for:
    -Â  updates of the European Framework Architecture
    -Â  the organisation and running of training coursesÂ 
    -Â  on-line assistance for those developing their own architectures

To understand what an
architecture consists of and how to create one:

* "What
                is a System Architecture?"   (PDF
                380KB)
* "Creating
                an Architecture" (PDF
                207KB)

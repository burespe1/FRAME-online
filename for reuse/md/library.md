There are a number of different types of document and report available from this page. Although some of them were created by earlier projects, much of their contents are still valid, especially those that relate to descriptions, techniques and processes. Since different readers will have different requirements, no attempt has been made to judge their current relevance, though their publication dates are provided for information. The different types of document and report are as follows:

* FRAME Architecture

* Other ITS Architecture Reports

* Articles and Papers

* Brochures

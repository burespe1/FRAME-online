**Informal Definition**
An Intelligent Transport System (ITS) Architecture is a set of high level viewpoints that enable plans to be made for integrating ITS applications and services. It normally covers technical aspects, plus the related organisational, legal and business issues.

ITS Architectures can be created at national, regional or city level, or relate to specific sectors or services. They help to ensure that the resulting ITS deployment:

* can be planned in a logical manner;
* integrates successfully with other systems;
* meets the desired performance levels;
* has the desired behaviour;
* is easy to manage;
* is easy to maintain;
* is easy to extend;
* satisfies the expectations of the users.

**Formal Definition**
An ITS architecture is the conceptual design that defines the structure and/or behavior of an integrated Intelligent Transport System (ITS).

An architecture description is a formal description of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structural properties of the system. It defines the system components or building blocks and provides a plan from which products can be procured, and systems developed, that will work together to implement the overall system. This may enable one to manage investment in a way that meets business needs.

**Technical Definition**
Thus an ITS Architecture is:

* a top-level framework;
* a strategic plan for designs;

non-deterministic;

it states “What is needed” and not “How it is to be implemented”;
it is technology independent;

the life-time of an ITS Architecture is normally longer than any particular technology;
* a set of top-level assumptions;

the minimun necessary  not  the maximum possible.

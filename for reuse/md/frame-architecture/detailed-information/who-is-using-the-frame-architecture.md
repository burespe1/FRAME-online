The FRAME Architecture was originally created so that it could be used by any Member State, Region, City or Project within the European Union. At present there is no “legislation” that says it must be used, and so it is currently only used by those who wish to use it (see below). The FRAME Architecture is European only insofar as its contents are targeted towards the way things are done within the EU. Any other part of the world with similar requirements to those in the EU could also use the FRAME Architecture.

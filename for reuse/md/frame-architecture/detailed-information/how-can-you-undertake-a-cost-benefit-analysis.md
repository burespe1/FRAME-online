Cost–benefit analysis is a systematic process for calculating and comparing benefits and costs of a project. The costs of an ITS project can be divided between the Capital Costs, e.g. for the acquisition and deployment of equipment, and the Revenue Costs, e.g. for staff. The benefits often cannot be quantified in monetary terms, but may include reduced delays, improved environment, etc.

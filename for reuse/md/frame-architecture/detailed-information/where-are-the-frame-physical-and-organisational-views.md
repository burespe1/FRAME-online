An overarching condition on the creators of the FRAME Architecture from the European level is that nothing should be imposed on the Member States because of subsidiarity (“you will not tell me how to design my system!”). This has resulted in an approach in which a European ITS Framework Architecture has been developed, which does not impose choices on its users, but allows them to develop their own framework sub-sets from it, and then to extend those sub-sets with their own choices for physical and communications views.

For the same reasons FRAME does not provide an organisational or management view, that also has to be added by those who have the power to decide one for their region, country, service, or for Europe.

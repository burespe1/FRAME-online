The Data Flows link the Functions to each other, to Terminators and Data Stores. They enable data to be moved around within the Architecture and are of the following three types:

* Functional Data Flows – carry data from one Function to another, or to/from the Data Stores.
* Terminator Data Flows – carry data to/from Terminators.
* Inter-Functional Area Data Flows – carry data from Functions in one Functional Area to those in another Functional Area.

All Data Flows have names that start with letter codes that define either the Functional Area in which they reside, the Terminator with which they are associated, or the Functional Areas that they link. A summary of these codes can be found in the ‘Acronym Definition’ page of the Browsing Tool.

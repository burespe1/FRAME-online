At its highest level, the Functional View consists of a number of Functional Areas, each of which contains the functionality that is responsible for a specific area of operations. This functionality is provided by a set of Functions and their related Data Stores. Each Functional Area has been given a specific number and a name identifying the area of responsibility involved. Thus the Area called “Manage Public Transport Operations” contains all the functionality required for that purpose.

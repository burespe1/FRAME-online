**Handledning för Systemarkitekturarbete inom / Handbook for ITS Architecture (2004)**
This handbook, which has been produced for the Swedish National Road Administration in cooperation with ITS Sweden, describes a methodology for producing an ITS Architecture. It provides an introduction to an important tool to promote a strategic architecture for the transport sector. A common system architecture creates the conditions for cooperation between different organisations and systems, which in turn provides the opportunity for an holistic approach to the transport system. With the help of a system architecture there can be clear descriptions of the relationships between services, systems and information which thus facilitate their development and deployment.

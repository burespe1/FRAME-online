The services supported are limited to those designed to support the driver in maintaining control of the vehicle, and in keeping within the current traffic regulations, with a particular set of functions allocated to support Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA).<br/><br/>The High-level Functions also provide functionality to enable the vehicle to communicate with organisations when its identification is required, or it is being used illegally.  Thet also include the functionality needed within a vehicle to support a Mayday service. Functions shall also monitor the status of the driver, provide a warning in case of impairment, and, together with the current status of the vehicle, record this data for future interrogation by authorised personnel. Functionality shall also enable floating car data to be provided to those that wish to us it, e.g. the Manage Traffic Area.<br/></H5><ul><h5><li>

<H5>These five Functions are responsible for controlling and monitoring the implementation of a plan for the transport of consignment by freight vehicle fleet resources.  Four of the Functions directly communicate with each other using two Data Flows for each link.  These and the other Function use remaining Data Flows to communicate with other functionality in the Area, with other Areas and with the Fleet Operator terminator.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 8.2.2.2 - DFD 8.2.2.2.     <br/></H5>

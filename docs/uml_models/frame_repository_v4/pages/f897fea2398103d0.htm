<H5>The Functions identify that a user has to pay and if no advanced payment has been made, collect the payment.  Radiating from these Functions are a large number of Data Flows, some of which enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  The remainder enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Provide Electronic Payment Facilities Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 1.3 - DFD 1.3.</H5>

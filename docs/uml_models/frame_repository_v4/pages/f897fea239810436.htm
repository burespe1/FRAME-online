<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall perform the strategic planning of all the Public Transport services on the basis of all available information about the availability of resources and a record of historical data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduling of all the Public Transport services shall mainly be performed off-line according to parameters such as analysis of demand, revenue, fleet and personnel resources, etc. It shall take into account the configuration of the road network so that the routes that are used by the services will be accessible to Public Transport vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific functionality dealing with the planning of car-pooling services, according to the demand and availability of travellers and drivers, shall also be provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of on-demand services shall also be defined by this Function as well as all definition and management of tariff schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Function shall consist of the following lower level Functions:</H5>

<H5>The Functions prepare schedules using data such as service strategies from the Public Transport Operator, the current schedules, historical vehicle data, data about the road network, traffic predictions and data from Multi-Modal Systems.  The schedules are then used to prepare fare schemes and as the basis for the deployment of car pooling services.<br/><br/>Between each of these Functions there are some Data Flows.  A minority of these Data Flows enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  However the vast majority of them enable the Functions to exchange data with other  parts of the Manage Public Transport Operations Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 4.2 - DFD 4.2.     <br/></H5>

<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall provide the facilities needed manage traffic using the inter-urban road network.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be possible for the Traffic to be managed through control measures that result in the output of indications to drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Function shall enable these indications to be such things as messages asking that certain other actions are taken, e.g. change lane, travel at or below a certain speed, divert to an alternative route, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall also be possible for priority for road use to be given to selected users through parts of the road network.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data about the movement of traffic in the inter-urban road network shall be collected and sent to other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, to other Areas, and other Systems for their own use.</H5>

However at this level the vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 3.1.2 - DFD 3.1.2.   <br/></H5>

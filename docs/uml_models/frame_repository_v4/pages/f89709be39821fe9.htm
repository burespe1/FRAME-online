<BODY CLASS="Content"> <center><h2>Low Level Function<br>3.1.7.1 Assess Tunnel Status and Take Action</h2></center><h3>Overview</H3><H5><div class="Normal">This Function shall be capable of providing the following facilities:<br><br>(1) The ability to management the traffic using one or more tunnels that are located on the road network served by the System.<br>(2) The ability to monitor one or more tunnels that are located on the road network served by the System.<br>(3) The ability to collect data about the traffic, environmental and other conditions within the tunnel(s) that it is managing using its own sensors or data from sensors attached to other systems, plus data provided by other systems about the operation of equipment such as fans and fire suppressors in the tunnel(s).<br>(4) The ability to automatically initiate action when unexpected conditions are detected, using actions that have been previously defined by the Tunnel Operator, including the output of messages to Drivers either directly in the tunnel(s) or through other roadside equipment outside the tunnel(s).<br>(5) If no action is defined, the ability to use the Tunnel Operator HMI provided by other functionality to present the Operator with options for actions to be taken that must either be accepted or amended before they are implemented.<br>(6) The ability to send both the actions taken and details about the unexpected conditions as an incident to the relevant part of other functionality within the System.<br>(7 The ability to also receive the details of the content of messages informing Drivers about traffic management strategies that should be output to Drivers using the tunnel(s) that it is managing in the absence of any higher priority messages of its own once confirmation is received from the Tunnel Operator through the HMI provided by other functionality.<br>(8) If any faults are detected with its sensors or other equipment, the ability to report this to the appropriate functionality within the System.<br></div></H5><h3>Functional Requirements</H3><h5>(a) continuously monitor for receipt of any of the input data flows<br/>(b) continuously scan the input of the traffic conditions in tunnel or tunnel atmospheric conditions data flows to determine traffic and atmospheric conditions in the tunnel<br/>(c) from the data produced in (b) determine if the conditions have become exceptional, e.g. congested traffic, presence of smoke, high level of pollutant gasses<br/>(d) if an exceptional condition is determined in (c), check to see if a pre-define action is available and if so, implement it<br/>(e) the implementation in (d) shall take the form of the output of messages for drivers by sending the tunnel information outputs data flow to the Output Tunnel Information to Drivers function and/or the output of instructions to other systems by sending the tunnel system outputs data flow to tunnel management systems, plus providing data about a possible incident to the Classify and Identify Incidents function in the tunnel unexpected conditions data flow and putting the contents of the output messages into the tunnel inter-urban inputs and tunnel urban inputs data flows and sending them to the Implement Inter-urban Traffic Commands and Implement Urban Traffic Commands functions respectively<br/>(f) the tunnel operator shall also be informed of the action taken through output of the actions for tunnel operator to the Provide Tunnel Operator Interface function<br/>(g) as a result of (f) monitor for receipt of the tunnel action responses data flow and if necessary use its contents to revise the actions taken in (e)<br/>(h) if no pre-defined action is found in (d), the tunnel operator shall be requested to define an action through output of a request in the actions for tunnel operator to the Provide Tunnel Operator Interface function<br/>(i) as a result of (h) continuously monitor for receipt of the tunnel action definitions data flow<br/>(j when the data flow in (i) is received, implement its contents by repeating (e) and (f)<br/>(k) as a result of (e) continuously monitor for receipt of the tunnel system inputs data flow<br/>(l) when the data flow in (k) is received, check its contents and if the response is not as expected, put a fault indication in the tunnel equipment status data flow and send it to the Evaluate Need for Equipment Maintenance function<br/>(m) continuously monitor for receipt of the inter-urban tunnel inputs and urban tunnel inputs data flows<br/>(n) when either of the data flows in (m) is received, check its contents for relevance to the tunnel(s) being managed by the system and for conflict with any outputs that are already being made<br/>(o) if the answer to (n) is that the contents are not relevant and/or the are conflicts with outputs already being made then do nothing, otherwise put the contents in the tunnel information outputs data flow and send it to the Output Tunnel Information to Drivers function<br/>(p) if the tunnel operator action responses data flow is received without any output having been made to the Provide Tunnel Operator Interface function, store its contents as actions for future automatic implementation when exceptional conditions are detected in (b) and (c).</H5><h3>Diagrams</H3><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><h5>The

<BODY CLASS="Content"> <center><h2>Low Level Function<br>9.4.2 Manage and Monitor Hazardous Goods Vehicle Routes</h2></center><h3>Overview</H3><H5><div class="Normal">This Function shall be capable of providing the following facilities:<br><br>(1) The ability to manage the use of routes by Vehicles carrying Hazardous Goods.<br>(2) The ability to get route for the Vehicle determined by the Trip Planning functionality using criteria provided by the Road Network Operator together with data about the actual route provided by the Driver through the a HMI on-board the Vehicle.<br>(3) The ability to keep all routes that are determined plus the criteria used to do this, the Vehicle details, route origin and destination as a record of what was used and in case they may be useful in the future in the store of Hazardous Vehicle Routes Data.<br>(4) When a route has been determined, the ability to send it to other functionality for actual implementation.<br>(5) The ability to monitor the progress of the Vehicle along the determined route.<br>(6) The ability to send a warning message to the Driver Interface Function to alert the Driver if the Vehicle is found to be deviating from the determined route.<br>(7) The ability to send details of the route to another instance of itself and to receive details of routes from other instances of itself.<br>(8) For routes received from other instances of itself, the ability to monitor the progress of the Vehicle according to the route and again send a warning message to the Driver Interface Function if a problem arises.<br></div></H5><h3>Functional Requirements</H3><h5>(a) continuously monitor for receipt of the hazardous goods vehicle route request data flow<br/>(b) when the data flow in (a) is received, extract the route determination criteria from the store of Hazardous Vehicle Routes Data using the hazardous routes data load and hazardous routes data read data flows<br/>(c) when (b) is complete, send the complete route determination data to the BBBB function in the hazardous goods vehicle route request data flow<br/>(d) continuously monitor for receipt of the hazardous goods vehicle route response data flow<br/>(e) when the data flow in (d) is received, load the route information into the store of Hazardous Vehicle Routes Data using the hazardous routes data load data flow<br/>(f) send the route information to the Provide Hazardous Goods Vehicle Route Management function in the hazardous goods vehicle route details data flow<br/>(g) continuously monitor for receipt of the hazardous goods vehicle route location data flow<br/>(h) when the data flow in (g) is received, check the location against the information about the route and if a deviation is found, send hazardous goods vehicle deviation from route data flow to the Provide Hazardous Goods Vehicle Driver Interface function<br/>(i) continuously monitor for the receipt of the hazardous goods vehicle incident strategy data flow from the Traffic Management functionality<br/>(j) when the data flow in (i) is received, assess the impact of the incident strategies on any routes that are currently being implemented<br/>(k) if as a result of (j) it is found that the uncompleted portions of any routes will be affected, repeat (c) to (f)<br/>(l) if the contents of the data flow in (g) shows that the route the vehicle is following will take it outside of the geographic area administered by this function, send the information about the uncompleted portion of the route plus the appropriate vehicle and hazardous goods information to another instance of the function (other related system) in the hazardous goods vehicle route details data flow<br/>(m) continuously monitor for receipt of the hazardous goods vehicle route details data flow from another instance of the function (other related system)<br/>(n) when the data flow in (m) is received, continue with (g) and (h)<br/>(o) continuously monitor for receipt of the hazardous goods vehicle route criteria input data flow<br/>(p) when the data flow in (o) is received, if it contains an update to the existing criteria, load it into the store of Hazardous Vehicle Routes Data using the hazardous routes data load data flow<br/>(q) if the data flow in (o) contains a request for the output of the current criteria, extract it from the store of Hazardous Vehicle Routes Data using the hazardous routes data load and hazardous routes data read data flows and send it to the Provide Manage Hazardous Goods Operator Interface function in the hazardous goods vehicle route criteria output data flow.</H5><h3>Diagrams</H3><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><h5>The Diagram(s) is (are) the diagram(s) where you can find the function :</h5></td></tr><tr><td width="100%"><h5><li> <a

<BODY CLASS="Content"> <center><h2>Low Level Function<br>3.5.7 Provide Road Maintenance Operator Interface</h2></center><h3>Overview</H3><H5><div class="Normal">This Function shall be capable of providing the following facilities:<br><br>(1) A HMI through which the Road Maintenance Operator can manage the maintenance activities.<br>(2) The ability for the HMI to enable the Road Maintenance Operator to confirm or reject both short term and long term maintenance activities plus de-icing activities, to review and update the criteria by which the need for maintenance and repair is decided and to monitor maintenance activities.<br>(3) The ability for the HMI to enable the Road Maintenance Operator to update and display the current status of maintenance activities and the static data that defines any devices used to manage traffic using the road network, including such things as location, type, etc.<br></div></H5><h3>Functional Requirements</H3><h5>(a) continuously monitor for receipt of any of the input data flows from other functionality in the system<br/>(b) when the confirm long term maintenance data flow is received in (a), put the data it contains into the maintenance activities required data flow and send it to the road maintenance operator<br/>(c) as a result of (b) continuously monitor for receipt of the confirm maintenance activities data flow from the road maintenance operator<br/>(d) when the data flow in (c) is received, put its contents into the long term maintenance confirmed data flow and send it to the Evaluate Need for Long Term Maintenance function<br/>(e) when the confirm short term maintenance data flow is received in (a), put the data it contains into the maintenance activities required data flow and send it to the road maintenance operator<br/>(f) as a result of (e) continuously monitor for receipt of the confirm maintenance activities data flow from the Road Maintenance Operator<br/>(g) when the data flow in (f) is received, put its contents into the short term maintenance confirmed data flow and send it to the Evaluate Need for Short Term Maintenance function<br/>(h) when the confirm equipment maintenance data flow is received in (a), put the data it contains into the maintenance activities required data flow and send it to the road maintenance operator<br/>(i) as a result of (h) continuously monitor for receipt of the confirm maintenance activities data flow from the road maintenance operator<br/>(j) when the data flow in (i) is received, put its contents into the equipment maintenance confirmed data flow and send it to the Evaluate Need for Equipment Maintenance function<br/>(k) when the proposed de-icing activities data flow is received in (a), put the data it contains into the proposed de-icing activities data flow and send it to the road maintenance operator<br/>(l) as a result of (k) continuously monitor for receipt of the confirmed de-icing activities data flow from the road maintenance operator<br/>(m) when the data flow in (l) is received, put its contents into the confirmed de-icing activities data flow and send it to the Evaluate Need for de-icing function<br/>(n) when the request activity status data flow is received from the road maintenance operator, put a request for the current activity status in the maintenance data updates data flow and send it to the Provide Maintenance Data Store Management function<br/>(o) as a result of (n) continuously monitor for receipt of the maintenance updates response data flow and when it is received, produce a report on current maintenance activities and send it to the road maintenance operator in the current activity status data flow<br/>(p) when the output current equipment faults data flow is received from the road maintenance operator, send the request current roadside equipment faults data flow to the Evaluate Need for Equipment Maintenance function<br/>(q) as a result of (p) continuously monitor for receipt of the current roadside equipment faults data flow and when it is received include it in the current equipment faults data flow and send it to the road maintenance operator<br/>(r) when either the request static data output data flow or the  data flow update static data are received from the road maintenance operator, put the request or the data update in the maintenance data updates data flow and send it to the Provide Maintenance Data Store Management function<br/>(s) as a result of (r) continuously monitor for receipt of the maintenance updates response data flow and when it is received, either put the actual static data in the data flow containing current static data, or the result of the update in the static data update completed data flow and send them to the road maintenance operator.</H5><h3>Diagrams</H3><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><h5>The Diagram(s) is (are) the diagram(s) where you can find the function :</h5></td></tr><tr><td

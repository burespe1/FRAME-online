<BODY CLASS="Content"> <center><h2>Low Level Function<br>9.3.1 Provide Vehicle Support for Sensitive Areas Access</h2></center><h3>Overview</H3><H5><div class="Normal">This Function shall be capable of providing the following facilities:<br><br>(1) The ability for to use various inputs that will enable it to identify that its host Vehicle is entering a part of the road network that has been designated as a &quot;sensitive are&quot;.<br>(2) When it finds that the host Vehicle will be entering a &quot;sensitive area&quot;, the ability to send an access request to the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function and include in the request details of the Vehicle identity, type and other details such as if hazardous goods are being carried.<br>(3) If access is granted the ability to continuously provide data about the location of the host Vehicle so that it can be tracked whilst it is in the &quot;sensitive area&quot;.<br>(4) When it detects that its host Vehicle is leaving the &quot;sensitive area&quot; it shall provide this information to the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function and shall provide a report to the Driver of the host Vehicle via other functionality.<br>(5) If the host Vehicle is not granted permission to access the &quot;sensitive area&quot; it shall output a message to the Driver, again via other functionality.<br></div></H5><h3>Functional Requirements</H3><h5>(a) continuously monitor for receipt of the map data for managing sensitive area access and vehicle data for sensitive areas data flows<br/>(b) when either of the data flows in (a) is received, store its contents internally for later use<br/>(c) continuously monitor for receipt of the nearing inter-urban sensitive area, nearing urban sensitive area and vehicle location for sensitive area access data flows<br/>(d) when either of the first two data flows in (c) is received, collect the vehicle data stored in (b) and send it to the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function in the request sensitive area entry permission data flow<br/>(e) when the third data flow in (c) is received use the location data and the map data stored in (b) to determine the current location and compare this with the location of any &quot;sensitive areas&quot; in the map data<br/>(f) if as a result of (e) it is indicated that a &quot;sensitive area&quot; is about to be entered, collect the vehicle data also stored in (b) and send it to the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function in the request sensitive area entry permission data flow<br/>(g) as a result of (d) and (f) continuously monitor for receipt of the requested sensitive area entry permission data flow from the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function<br/>(h) when the data flow in (g) is received, determine if the result is that access has been granted or not<br/>(i) if the answer in (h) is that access has not been granted, use the results of (e) to determine whether the &quot;sensitive area&quot; is in the inter-urban or urban road network<br/>(j) depending on the result from (i) put the vehicle identify in either the inter-urban sensitive area access refused or urban sensitive area access refused data flow and send it to either the Prevent Access to Inter-urban Zones or the Prevent Access to Urban Zones function as appropriate<br/>(k) when (j) has been completed, putting a refusal response in the driver instructions for sensitive areas data flow before sending it to the Output Comments and Dynamic Warnings function<br/>(l) if the answer in (h) is that access has been granted, put a acceptance response plus any driver instructions containing in the data flow in (g) in the driver restrictions for sensitive areas data flow before sending it to the Output Comments and Dynamic Warnings function<br/>(m) as a result of (l) continuously monitor for receipt of the vehicle location for sensitive area access data flow<br/>(n) whenever the data flow in (m) is received, use the map data received in (b) to check that the location is still within the &quot;sensitive area&quot;<br/>(o) if the check in (n) shows that the location is still within the &quot;sensitive area&quot;, send it to the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function in the current vehicle location in sensitive area data flow<br/>(p) if the check in (n) shows that the location is outside the &quot;sensitive area&quot;, send this information to the Manage Data about Vehicle use of Sensitive Areas function in the vehicle leaving sensitive area data flow<br/>(q) having completed (p) create a report for the driver about the use of the &quot;sensitive area&quot; and send it to the Output Comments and Dynamic Warnings function in the driver report from sensitive area data flow.</H5><h3>Diagrams</H3><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><h5>The Diagram(s) is (are) the diagram(s) where you can find the function :</h5></td></tr><tr><td width="100%"><h5><li> <a href="23442A984BCC0570.HTM?DiagTab=1" Target="_self">DFD 9.3 Manage Vehicle access to Sensitive Areas</a><h5><li> <a href="2ED039D74B4B048B.HTM?DiagTab=0" Target="_self">Functional Tree of Area 9</a></li></h5></td></tr></table><h3>Parent Higher Level Function</H3><h5><ul><li>

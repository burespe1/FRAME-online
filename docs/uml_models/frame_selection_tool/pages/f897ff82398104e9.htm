<H5>These two Functions process the data about the fraud that has been received from other Areas to produce a prosecution file.  There is one Data Flow to link the two Functions and a few Data Flows that enable them to obtain data from Data Stores.  There are several other Data Flows that enable the Functions to communication with other functionality in the Area and with the Law Enforcement Agency terminator.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 7.2 - DFD 7.2.   <br/></H5>

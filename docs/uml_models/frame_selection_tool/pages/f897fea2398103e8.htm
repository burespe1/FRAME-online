<H5>The Functions gather data about the emergencies as and when they occur, and manage the response of the Emergency Services.  The data may come directly from vehicles, the roadside, functionality in other Areas, or from other Systems.<br/><br/>Radiating from these Functions are a large number of Data Flows.  A minority of these enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  The vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 2.1 - DFD 2.1.   <br/></H5>

<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall provide facilities for the management of car parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are assumed to exist in the urban environment, although in practice as an alternative they could be used in the inter-urban environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilities enable the use of car park spaces to be monitored both in terms of the numbers being used (car park occupancy and/or car park state) and the time that individual spaces are used.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequent state of car parks is output directly to Drivers. It is also possible for Drivers to be charged for the use of particular car park spaces and for them to be prosecuted for overstaying their time in a particular space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the car park occupancy and status is passed to the Trip Planning and Traffic Management data storage facilities, as well as to the inter-urban service area management facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities are provided in this High-level Function for the direct output to Drivers of information about the status of service areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parking Operator is able to provide data about the spaces available in each car park, monitor the use of the car parks, to override the status setting (e.g. to close a car park) and to obtain a record of the payment for the use of car park spaces. </H5>

<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall be responsible for the management and imposition of strategies to manage the way that Vehicles are using the inter-urban road network.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be able to impose strategies on some or all of the inter-urban road network managed by the System, either as part of a pre-determined timetable of changes, or at the command of the Road Network Operator, or taking account of strategies that are being used in to manag the urban road network.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Operator shall in fact be able to override one or more of the planned strategies in all or part(s) of the inter-urban road network.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall also be possible for the strategies to be modified to take account of conditions on any tunnels and/or bridges and to take account of environmental conditions.</H5>

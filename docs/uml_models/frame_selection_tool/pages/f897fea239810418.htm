<H5>The Functions use the definition of an &quot;incident&quot; which says that it is an out of the ordinary occurrence.  Therefore normal peak travel congestion does not qualify as an &quot;incident&quot; unless it is made worse by some other event.  This may be planned, e.g. a parade, or be due to a random event such as a road traffic accident, or a major fire in a building next to part of the road network.<br/><br/>Between each of these Functions there are some Data Flows.  A minority of these enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  However the vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 3.2 - DFD 3.2.       <br/></H5>

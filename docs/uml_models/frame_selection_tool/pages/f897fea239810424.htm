<H5>The Functions gather data about the environment from a variety of sources, concentrating mainly on the atmosphere and noise.  The data is collected and made available to other Functions in the Manage Traffic Area and to other Areas, as well as in the form of reports to the Operator.<br/><br/>Between each of these Functions there are some Data Flows.  A minority of these enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  However the vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 3.4 - DFD 3.4.       <br/></H5>

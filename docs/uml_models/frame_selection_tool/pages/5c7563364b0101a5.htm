<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall provide facilities for the management of service areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are assumed to exist in the inter-urban environment, although in practice as an alternative they could be used in the urban environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilities enable the use of service area spaces to be monitored in terms of the numbers being used (service area occupancy and/or state) and for the consequent state to be output directly to Drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the service area occupancy and status is passed to the Trip Planning and Traffic Management data storage facilities, as well as to the urban car park management facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities are provided in this High-level Function for the direct output to Drivers of information about the status of car parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parking Operator is able to provide data about the spaces available in each service area, monitor the use of the service area and to override the status setting, e.g. to close a service area.</H5>

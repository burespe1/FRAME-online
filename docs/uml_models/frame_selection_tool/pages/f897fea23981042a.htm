<H5>The Functions gather data about the use being made of the road network, local road and pavement surface conditions and equipment functioning.  This data is analysed and used to instruct the Maintenance Organisation to carry out maintenance and/or repair work, and to apply de-icing treatment when conditions demonstrate it is needed.<br/><br/>Between each of these Functions there are some Data Flows.  A minority of these enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  However the vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 3.5 - DFD 3.5.     <br/></H5>

<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall include facilities for the generation of the initial trip under feedback of the traveller, taking into account all kinds of perturbations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trip planning is the most complex and complete action to be performed by the Plan Trip facility, but on many occasions the traveller is interested in the planning of a trip from beginning to end, because that is a well-known thing and needs no further planning. In such a case the traveller usually is interested in the deviation from his/her expectation: travel and traffic information (TTI). While the Plan Trip function is able to access such information to develop the best trip plan possible, under the given circumstances, the TTI function is assumed to be incorporated in the Plan Trip function. For obvious reasons, the trip performed can be stored as a skeleton in the GTP and the traveller, when asking the system, will be informed about the perturbations ahead only. This will result in more selective information and a better user-orientation.</H5>

<H5>These eight Functions enable a Traveller to plan a trip.  They are linked by a few Data Flows and also have single Data Flows that enable them to load and read data to and from the Data Stores.  Several Data Flows are provided for the exchange of data with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 6.2 - DFD 6.2.     <br/></H5>

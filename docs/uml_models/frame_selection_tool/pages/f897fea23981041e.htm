<H5>The Functions use the term &quot;demand&quot; to mean the desire for travellers to use particular modes of transport.  Facilities are provided by these Functions to enable this demand to be managed so that the use of one mode does not dominate the others, unless this is required by national or local transport policies.  This also enables priority to be given to certain modes of transport, again only if this is a goal of national or local policies.<br/><br/>Between each of these Functions there are some Data Flows.  A minority of these enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  However the vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 3.3 - DFD 3.3.     <br/></H5>

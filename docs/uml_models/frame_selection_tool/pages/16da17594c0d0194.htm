<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5>This High-level Function shall provide facilities that enable the Host Vehicle to detect various forms of entity in the geographic area in its immediate surrounding.&nbsp;&nbsp;The various forms of entity shall include equipped Vehicles, other road users (i.e. non-equipped Vehicles, Cyclists and Motorcyclists), Pedestrians, Atmospheric Environment, visibility, the road surface and Stationary Objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Function shall use the data it collects from the detection process together with data about the way that the Host Vehicle is operating to determine any possible conflicts and/or unsafe situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Driver of the Host Vehicle will be sent warnings about these by the Function, which will also pass the data about the conflict and/or unsafe situations to Other Vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the data collected, such as visibility, will be combined with the data provided by Other Vehicles to provide a more comprehensive picture to the Driver of the Host Vehicle.</H5>

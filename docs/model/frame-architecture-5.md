1.	FRAME repository is a library of User Needs and functions, which are grouped into several Functional Areas covering whole ITS. The repository is used in first phases of creation of the specific architectures, when an architect selects based on the stakeholders aspirations a user needs fulfilling those aspirations and leading to a specific functionality.

2.	FRAME meta model defines objects used by updated FRAME. The meta-model has a different structuring than the final views of the architecture, it structures the FRAME artefacts into five sections. The first four sections develop from a high-level perspective down to more technical details of the service. The last layer contains artefacts, which are relevant for all sections. 

	The sections are __Motivational Layer__, __Business Layer__, __Application Layer__, __Data Layer__ and __External__

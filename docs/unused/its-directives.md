# ITS Directives

In many places the ITS Action Plan refers to specific technologies, e.g. the EGNOS/Galileo positioning system, RFID and open in-vehicle platform architecture. Such technology dependent issues should not be visible within an ITS Architecture, but the functionality they provide should be, and most – if not all – is already within the FRAME Architecture. The ITS Architecture defines the various interfaces that exist between components, and the use of specific technology at those interfaces needs to be covered by standards, whose use may be mandated through the ITS Directive.

## Supporting the ITS Action Plan
Once the European Specification for each ITS application and service 
has been agreed, an ITS architecture for it can be created using a 
sub-set of the FRAME Architecture.  This will enable the required 
standards to be identified and, if necessary, their creation initiated. 
 It will also provide a technology independent description of each 
application and service so that manufacturers and suppliers can ensure 
their products will work together as required.  This creation of each 
European Specification should be done by a team of experts in the topic 
under consideration, with the addition of a small ITS Architecture team 
who will also ensure a common “look and feel” to the result.

This process will inevitably result in the creation of Physical, and 
possibly other, Views for use throughout the EU.  These can then be used
 directly by, for example, application developers allowing them to 
respond to a quickly changing market but preserving the links to the 
overall structure.  Thus, over time, the need for separate bespoke ITS 
Architectures within Member States, or parts of Member States, may 
diminish.

## Advantages of this Approach

 - Common Language – Each resulting ITS Architecture will be based on the FRAME Architecture, and thus use the same terminology.
 - Common elements will be easy to identify, as will 
be the merging of two or more ITS Architectures.  Thus will be important
 as Member States with their own ITS Architectures need to include those
 that result from the ITS Action Plan or ITS Directive.
 - Efficient – The FRAME Architecture already exists 
and contains about 80% of the work that will be needed to be done to 
create the ITS Architectures.

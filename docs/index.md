# European Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Framework Architecture

FRAME, an acronym for the FRamework Architecture Made for Europe, is a minimum stable framework necessary for the deployment of integrated and interoperable ITS. 

The FRAME is developed as a framework that provides a systematic basis for planning ITS implementations in Europe. It facilitates their integration when deploying multiple systems and helps ensure interoperability, across European countries. A distinctive feature of the FRAME is that it sets out all ITS functionality, from which smaller systems and subsets are created, describing a specific service, or set of services. It offers more than one way of performing a service, allowing users to select the most appropriate set of functionalities for their environment. 

The development methodology, supported by computer-based tools, assists in creating logically consistent subsets of the FRAME architecture functional view and subsequent physical, communication and organizational views. Thus, the FRAME architecture serves as a framework from which specific models of integrated ITS can be systematically created.

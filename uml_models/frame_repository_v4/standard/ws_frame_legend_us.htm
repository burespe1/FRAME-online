          An org-unit is an organizational element of the enterprise such as a 
          department, a service, or a workstation. An internal org-unit is defined based 
          on how detailed you require your view of the enterprise to be. Examples: 
          financial management, sales management, marketing department, account manager. 
          An external org-unit is an organization that exchanges flows with the 
          enterprise. Examples: Customer, Supplier, Government Office.

          A Content designates the content of a message or an event, independently of its 
          structure. The structure is represented by an XML schema linked to the content. 
          A content may be used by several messages, since it is not associated with an 
          emitter and a destination. There can only be one content per message or event, 
          but the same content can be used by multiple messages or events.

          An operation is a step in a procedure, executed by an org-unit within the 
          context of an activity. An operation can be industrial (manufacturing a 
          component), logistical (receiving a delivery), or can involve information 
          processing (entering an order). An operation can be subdivided into elementary 
          tasks.

          A service is a component of an application that is available to the end user of 
          the application. Services are the breakdown of an application into its basic 
          functional units. A service is a consistent, indivisible unit of processing 
          that coordinates a set of messages and events in order to perform a task in the 
          information system. In the application architecture, the service is the most 
          basic functional unit.

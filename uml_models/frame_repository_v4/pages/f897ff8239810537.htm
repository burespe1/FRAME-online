<H5>These Functions are responsible for the management of tasks and transport orders being carried out by freight vehicles.  The first second and fourth Functions communicate with the third Function through one or two Data Flows.  Each Function uses several other Data Flows to communications with other functionality in the Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 8.3.1 - DFD 8.3.1.     <br/></H5>

<h3>Overview</H3>
<H5><div class="Normal">This High-level Function shall provide support for a trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the trip perturbations may come into existence which may influence the performance of the trip. Using the itinerary the consequences are evaluated and corrections are suggested to the on-trip traveller. Also routing instructions and possibly re-routing can be delivered.<br><br>It shall be possible for the functionality in this High-Level Function to be used by the Traveller if they are in need of certain information about what is to be expected on the next leg(s) of the trip. In this instance it shall be possible for dedicated questions to be put to the Traffic and Travel Information (TTI) sub-functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally it shall be possible for a &quot;trip skeleton&quot; to be used to extract more accurate and more selective information faster from the Support Trip facility.</div></H5>

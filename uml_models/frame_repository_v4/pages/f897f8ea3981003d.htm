Manage Freight and Fleet Operations</h2></center><br><h3>Description</H3><h5>This Area shall provide functionality that enables the management of Freight and Fleet Operations.  This shall control the use of freight vehicles and their transportation of goods.  The use of other modes of freight transport shall also be supported.  An interface to the Provide Safety and Emergency Facilities Area shall also be included to enable the provision of information about hazardous goods.  Route planning for this and other types of goods shall be provided through the interface to the Provide Traveller Journey Assistance Area.</H5><h5></H5><br><h3>Component Functions</H3><H5>This Functional Area contains three High-level Functions.  Between them they provide facilities for the management of freight and fleet operations in two situations.<br/><br/>The first two Functions (F 8.1 and F 8.2) provide functionality for a static freight and fleet operations centre.  This centre can accept goods (freight) for transportation from one location to another.  The route will be chosen and this may involve the use of modes other than that provided by road transport.  If necessary, the goods can be stored at points along the route to enable the most optimum scheduling to be used.  The second Function (F 8.2) can also manage the operation of a fleet of freight vehicles.  This includes the scheduling and specification of drive duties and vehicle maintenance.<br/><br/>The third Function (F 8.3) provides functionality for the management of freight and fleet operations that are on-board a freight vehicle.  It receives instructions about route plans and schedules and other information from the second Function (F 8.2).  It also provides that Function with information about vehicle status, incidents and payments that have been made for things such as tolls.</H5><ul><h5><li>

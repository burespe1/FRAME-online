<H5>The Functions listed on the previous page enable a response to be planned for each emergency as and when it occurs.  Once the intervention is in progress, the status is monitored and progress reports produced.<br/><br/>Between each of these Functions there are several Data Flows.  About half of these enable the Functions to exchange data with each other.  The remainder enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Provide Safety and Emergency Facilities Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 2.1.2 - DFD 2.1.2.       <br/></H5>

<BODY CLASS="Content"> <center><h2>Low Level Function<br>4.7.3 Implement On-Demand Service</h2></center><h3>Overview</H3><H5><div class="Normal">This Function shall be capable of providing the following facilities:<br><br>(1) The ability to implement On-Demand Services that have been confirmed by Pre-Trip Travellers. <br>(2) For the implementation of a Service it shall be possible to use the most appropriate Vehicle and Driver and to provide the Driver with details of the Service.<br>(3) Part of the Service implementation shall also include the provision of the participating Travellers with the predicted arrival time of the Vehicle delivering the Service at each Traveller&#39;s pick-up point.<br>(4) During the Service implementation it shall be possible for contact to be maintained with the Vehicle delivering it, so that changes in location and status can be tracked, and messages (voice and data) can be exchanged with the Vehicle Driver.<br>(5) The ability to determine whether or not the Vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;delivering the Service is keeping to the schedule for the Service and if necessary request priority for the Vehicle at any of the signalised junctions on the route in order to regain compliance with the schedule. <br>(6) The ability to propose modifications to the planned Service route to the Vehicle Driver, if this will improve the Service performance. <br>(7) The ability to send information about Vehicles that are faulty to the maintenance management functionality and these Vehicles shall not be used until it is confirmed that they are now available for use.<br>(8) The ability to create and store details of the performance of the delivery of Services and of the Vehicles involved so that they can be requested by and sent to the functionality providing the HMI for the On-Demand Service Operator.<br></div></H5><h3>Functional Requirements</H3><h5>(a) when the confirmed demand service data flow is received, take the details of the service from it and set up an entry in the store of On-Demand Service Performance Data, to record how the service is performed<br/>(b) check the existing services in the store of On-Demand Service Performance Data to find an available driver, i.e. one that will be available to perform the new service<br/>(c) if the new service is not a modification to an existing service, send the instructions for its implementation direct to a driver identified in (b) in the service instructions data flow<br/>(d) if no acknowledgement is received to the data flow in (c) select another driver and repeat (c)<br/>(e) if the new service is a modification to an existing service, use the service instructions for demand driver data flow to send the instructions for its implementation to the Monitor On-Demand Service Vehicle function for output to its driver<br/>(f) send the predicted arrival time of the On-Demand Service Vehicle that is performing the new service to the on-demand service passenger using the arrival prediction data flow (note by accepting the service and making any payments, the pre-trip traveller has become an on-demand service passenger)<br/>(g) continuously monitor the vehicle status data flow from the Monitor On-Demand Service Vehicle function and update the entry for the service in the store of On-Demand Service Performance Data<br/>(h) use the data provided in (g) to calculate the predicted arrival time of the Vehicle at its next stop and use the demand service arrival prediction data flow to send it to the <br/>(i) if the message in (g) indicates that the vehicle needs priority at one more signalised road junctions, request this using the data flow to the Manage Traffic functionality Monitor On-Demand Service Vehicle function for output to the passenger<br/>(j) if the message in (g) indicates that the vehicle has a fault, then send the fault data flow to the Maintenance function<br/>(k) as a result of (j) use the store of On-Demand Service Performance Data to find a replacement vehicle and driver and provide new instructions to the driver for the completion of the service<br/>(l) when the vehicle repaired data flow is received, update its status in the store of On-Demand Service Performance Data so that it is now available for use on future services<br/>(m) if the message from driver data flow is received, immediately use the message from driver to operator data flow to send it to the Operator Interface function for output to the driver<br/>(n) if the message from operator to driver data flow is received, send its contents to the Monitor On-Demand Service Vehicle function for output to its driver<br/>(o) if the data flow requesting demand service performance is received the collect the relevant data from the store of On-Demand Service Performance Data and use the service performance data flow to send it to the Operator Interface function for output to the driver</H5><h3>Diagrams</H3><table border="1"

<H5>A few of the Data Flows between these Functions enable them to exchange data with each other.  However at this level the vast majority enable the Functions to exchange data with other parts of the Manage Traffic Area, with other Areas and with the terminators.  The Functions and Data Flows are contained in the DFD for Function 3.1.1 - DFD 3.1.1.     <br/></H5>

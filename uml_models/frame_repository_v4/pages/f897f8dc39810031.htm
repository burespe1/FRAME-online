Provide Traveller Journey Assistance</h2></center><br><h3>Description</H3><h5>This Functional Area shall provide functionality that enables the provision of information to all types of Travellers about traffic conditions and about other modes of transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;The functionality shall also provide pre-trip journey planning, including special routes for Emergency Vehicles and Goods Vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;On-trip route guidance shall also be provided, together with the ability to change a trip itinerary due to Traveller input, or the occurrence of events that affect the flow of Vehicles through the road network.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the trip planning process, the functionality shall provide access to other services such as accommodation and to other transport modes.</H5><h5></H5><br><h3>Component Functions</H3><H5>The four High-Level Functions in this Area form a logical chain that enables the Traveller to plan a trip using General Trip Preferences (GTP&#39;s) and/or Actual Trip Preferences (ATP&#39;s).  This activity is interactive so that the Traveller can change the ATP for the trip if the originals do not provide the optimum trip and can also refine a trip itinerary until it is satisfactory.  The trip can cover several modes, including those outside the road domain, such as heavy rail, air and maritime.  The Traveller can also ask for information about points of interest and information about other facilities that will be passed by when the trip plan is implemented.<br/><br/>Bookings and payment for any of the services can be made once the trip plan has been accepted by the Traveller.  The result is a trip plan that can then be implemented and updated in real time if perturbations occur within the travel network.  At the end of the trip, the GTP data can be updated as a result of experiences on the trip.  If requested by the Travel Information Operator, a trip evaluation report can also be produced.  This will show how successful the trip plan was, and any changes needed to accommodate perturbations in the travel network.<br/><br/>The Traveller can also use the functionality just to obtain travel information rather than to make an actual trip plan.  Functionality is provided to enable the Traveller to be asked to pay for the trip planning and travel information, if required for a particular ITS deployment.<br/><br/></H5><ul><h5><li>

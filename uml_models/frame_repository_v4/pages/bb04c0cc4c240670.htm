Information to Urban Roads function and the other vehicle lane departure warning data flow to the Provide V2V Communications function<br/>(j) use the data from (b) and (c) to determine if the host vehicle is about to enter a curve that has been classified as a black spot for that category of vehicle, and send suitable action(s) for the driver take in the road curve ahead warning data flow to the Provide Vehicle Trajectory Information to Driver function<br/>(k) also use the data from (b) and (c) to determine if the host vehicle is being driven the wrong way down the carriageway that it is occupying, i.e. it is a &quot;ghost driver&quot;<br/>(l) if the result of (k) is that the host vehicle is a &quot;ghost driver&quot;, put data for a warning message to be output to the driver in the host vehicle with advice on the actions the driver must take into the ghost driving warning data flow and send it to the Provide Vehicle Trajectory Information to Driver function<br/>(m) if the result of (c) is that the host vehicle is about to change lanes check the other vehicle trajectory for host vehicle data flow received in (a) to see if the manoeuvre will cause conflict with another vehicle, e.g. overtaking one vehicle will cause the host vehicle to move into the path of an on- coming vehicle in the carriageway/lane being used for the overtaking<br/>(n) if the result of (m) is that the host vehicle will move into the carriageway/lane that is occupied by an approaching vehicle, send data for a warning message to the driver in the un-safe overtaking manoeuvre warning data flow to the Provide Vehicle Trajectory Information to Driver function and to the other vehicle in the un-safe overtaking warning for other vehicle data flow to the Provide V2V Communications function.<br/></H5><h3>Diagrams</H3><table border="1" width="100%"><tr><td><h5>The Diagram(s) is (are) the diagram(s) where you can find the function :</h5></td></tr><tr><td width="100%"><h5><li> <a href="E098F4554C2D0649.HTM?DiagTab=1" Target="_self">DFD 5.15.3 Determine Host Vehicle Situation</a><h5><li> <a href="F897F8D63981002B.HTM?DiagTab=0" Target="_self">Functional Tree of Area 5</a></li></h5></td></tr></table><h3>Parent Higher Level Function</H3><h5><ul><li>

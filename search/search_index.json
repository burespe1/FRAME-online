Services, using and providing information, which optimize local performance, provide cross-border continuity and seamlessness and provide the basis for multimodality. A modern road-based transport system will be dependent on a number of Intelligent Transport Systems and Services (ITS), based on telematics, components, automated systems for traffic control and management, fleet management (public transport and goods vehicles) and road pricing. The vehicles using the network are increasingly being equipped with automated support systems and services to enhance driving safety and efficiency. The maximum benefit to end users and other stakeholders will be created from these systems when they are fully integrated or harmonized so that they can share data and operate together in a coordinated manner. Effective cooperation is also needed if stakeholders want to offer advanced services such as cross-modal traveller information and cross-organisational and cross-border traffic management. These services are only feasible by seamless collaboration of ITS actors in ITS value chains and networks, as these require information sharing, particularly if multi-modal journeys or transport are to be promoted.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#common-pan-european-its-architecture","title":"Common Pan-European ITS Architecture","text":"<p>Archive a Common Pan-European ITS Architecture that includes the necessary priorities/services for ITS \u2013 This will be done by modifying and enhancing the existing FRAME Architecture so that it reflects the results of the various projects in this and other programmes as well as the obligations which came with the ITS Directive and the results of the recent work by CEN TC278 PT1701 on the barriers to Urban ITS deployment.In the FRAME NEXT Architecture it will be particularly important to enable the identification of the functional chains that link the collection of raw data through its processing to its use in such things as the management of the road network, dissemination of travel information support to public transport and support to freight transport.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#frame-seems-to-be-too-complex-is-there-a-summary-of-its-contents-for-the-decision-makers","title":"FRAME seems to be too complex.

Each Function is cross-referenced to one or more User Needs for which it helps to provide primary functionality.</li> <li>Creating ITS Architecture Sub-sets \u2013 see Creating an ITS Architecture using FRAME.</li> <li>Describing ITS Applications and Services \u2013 The User Needs provide a description of most ITS applications and services that might be required anywhere within the European Union. They can therefore be used for this descriptive purpose alone, e.g. by a research student wishing to know what ITS applications and services are being considered.</li> </ul> <p>In order to satisfy these uses the User Needs need to be written in a manner that is clear and unambiguous, and at a level of abstraction that is sufficient to describe the primary functionality but without unnecessary detail. They should thus have the following properties:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cShall language\u201d \u2013 In order to ensure that the User Needs specify what the functionality in the Functional View has to do, or features that must be included in the sub-systems and modules defined in the Physical View, they are written (in English) using the phraseology \u201cThe system shall\u2026\u201d. This ensures that each User Need is written from the systems\u2019 point of view, and hence states the functionality required of that system, and not from the users\u2019 point of view, which is likely to state how the results are to be used (and may be interpreted in more than one way).</li> <li>Short \u2013 User Needs are the entry points into the Functional View, and need to contain sufficient detail to identify the entry point precisely \u2013 only. When they are being written each phrase must have the answer \u201cyes\u201d to the question \u201cis this necessary?\u201d. A typical User Need comprises one English sentence three to five lines long (the original User Needs produced by KAREN were limited to 255 characters).</li> <li>Technology Independence \u2013 since the FRAME Architecture will have a lifespan longer than the technology that will be used to implement its features, the User Needs should state what the system is required to do, but not the mechanism for achieving it. Those User Needs that do not relate to functionality, e.g. Communications, Physical locations, should also follow this principle.</li> <li>Unambiguous \u2013 the meaning must be absolutely clear from the description. Thus, for example, whenever the word \u201cinformation\u201d is used it must be obvious from the context what should be contained within that information, otherwise it should be specified.</li> <li>Testable \u2013 since they form the basis of the FRAME Architecture and what is implemented from it, they must be written in a manner such that it is possible to check that each User Need is represented in some manner in the FRAME Architecture or the implementation.</li> <li>Traceable and Unique \u2013 since it must be possible to trace the manifestation of a User Need in a FRAME Architecture sub-set each User Need must have a unique identifier.</li> <li>Singular \u2013 If a User Need gives rise to a set of functionalities, it is assumed that all those functionalities will be required on every occasion the service is implemented. If this is not the case then it should be broken down into a number of separate User Needs.</li> </ul> <p>On occasions these properties can be in conflict, in particular when writing User Needs which are unambiguous and singular, but also short, especially as there is a general desire not to have too many User Needs in the entire FRAME Architecture. Whilst no universal way has yet been found to resolve all such conflicts, some can be avoided by starting with a \u201chigh-level\u201d User Need that describes a basic form of an application or service, followed by a number of optional extra User Needs that contain the detail of specific features.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-you-use-the-organisational-view","title":"How can you use the Organisational View?","text":"<p>The Organisational View is usually a derivative of the Physical View.

Indeed, on occasions, it contains more than one way of performing a service and the user can select the most appropriate set of functionality to deliver it in that environment. Thus the FRAME Architecture is not so much a model of integrated ITS, as a framework from which specific models of integrated ITS can be created in a systematic and common manner.</p> <p>Areas covered by FRAME Architecture</p> <p>The FRAME Architecture now covers the following areas of ITS:</p> <ul> <li>Electronic Fee Collection</li> <li>Emergency Notification and Response \u2013 Roadside and In-Vehicle Notification</li> <li>Traffic Management \u2013 Urban, Inter-Urban, Parking, Tunnels and Bridges, Maintenance and Simulation, together with the Management of Incidents, Road Vehicle Based Pollution and the Demand for Road Use</li> <li>Public Transport Management \u2013 Schedules, Fares, On-Demand Services, Fleet and Driver Management</li> <li>In-Vehicle Systems \u2013 includes some Cooperative Systems</li> <li>Traveller Assistance \u2013 Pre-Journey and On-Trip Planning, Travel Information</li> <li>Support for Law Enforcement</li> <li>Freight and Fleet Management</li> <li>Provide Support for Cooperative Systems \u2013 specific services not included elsewhere, e.g. bus lane use, freight vehicle parking</li> <li>Multi-modal interfaces \u2013 links to other modes when required, e.g. travel information, multi-modal crossing management</li> </ul> <p>Because the FRAME Architecture is intended for use within the European Union it conforms to the precepts of subsidiarity, and thus does not mandate any physical or organisational structure on a Member State. It comprises only a set of User Needs which describe what ITS can provide, and a Functional View showing how it can be done. The Methodology, which is supported by computer-based tools, assists the creation of logically consistent sub-sets of the FRAME Architecture Functional View, and the creation of subsequent Physical Views.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/frame-architecture/#use-of-frame-in-europe","title":"Use of FRAME in Europe","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/frame-architecture/#framework-principle","title":"Framework Principle","text":"<p>A principal objective for the FRAME Architecture is to promote the deployment of ITS in Europe by producing a framework which would provide a systematic basis for planning ITS implementations, facilitate their integration when multiple systems were to be deployed, and help to ensure inter-operability, including across European borders.</p> <p>The FRAME Architecture achieves this objective by providing a model of almost all of ITS from which specific sub-sets of integrated ITS can be created in a systematic and common manner.

At the highest level is the Context Diagram (see figure below) which shows all the functionality supported by the FRAME Architecture inside a box labelled \u201cSystem\u201d surrounded by a set of \u201cTerminators\u201d, which are outside the boundary of the system. Each Terminator represents some thing, or person, to which the system will send data and/or from which it will receive data. As there is a large amount of functionality in the FRAME Architecture (2-3000 elements in total), its size is managed using hierarchies of functions and terminators.</p> <p></p> <p>The FRAME System in the figure above is divided into 9 Areas (see below). Each Area then has a number of hierarchical levels of functions as required, with each High-Level Function being decomposed into a number of lower-level Functions until the final Low-Level Functions are reached. Initially it was thought that the High-Level Functions would be used during the sub-set creation process, but it was quickly found that, whilst many of the corresponding Low-Level Functions were required in a given situation, not all them were. That, and the difficulty of following data flows through the hierarchy of functions, has resulted in the High-Level Functions being used solely for convenience when creating or looking at the entire FRAME Architecture. Thus the FRAME Architecture Functional View is now defined with its Low-Level Functions, and the creation of sub-sets is performed using only them.</p> <p>The name \u201cTerminator\u201d derives from the fact that the data for, and produced by, the System starts/stops there. The FRAME Architecture sub-divides some of its Terminators into a number of Actors. Not only does this make the total architecture more manageable, especially the construction of the diagrams, but it is also useful for situations when some data goes to/from all Actors in the Terminator, e.g. all Drivers, and on other occasions data goes to/from a specific Actor, e.g. Public Transport Driver.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/frame-architecture/#the-9-areas-of-the-frame-architecture","title":"The 9 Areas of the FRAME Architecture","text":"<p>The FRAME Architecture models road based ITS applications and services, and is divided into the following nine broad Areas:</p> <ul> <li>Provide Electronic Payment Facilities</li> <li>Provide Safety and Emergency Facilities \u2013 includes both in-vehicle and roadside \u201ceCall\u201d plus the management of the Emergency Services responses</li> <li>Manage Traffic \u2013 includes urban and inter-urban traffic management, plus parking, incident and demand management</li> <li>Manage Public Transport Operations \u2013 includes both regular and on-demand services, plus fare cards and vehicle sharing</li> <li>Provide Advanced Driving Assistance Systems \u2013 includes support for in-vehicle services some of which are part of cooperative systems</li> <li>Provide Traveller Journey Assistance \u2013 includes both pre- and on-trip planning, plus traveller information</li> <li>Provide Support for Law Enforcement</li> <li>Manage Freight and Fleet Operations</li> <li>Provide Support for Cooperative Systems \u2013 includes support for cooperative systems not included elsewhere</li> </ul> <p>Links to other modes of transport are made through the Terminator \u201cMulti-Modal System\u201d, which is used to provide travellers with multi-modal travel information, to manage multi-modal crossings and incidents that take place on other modes.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/in-a-nutshell/","title":"What is the ITS Architecture?","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/in-a-nutshell/#definitions","title":"Definitions","text":"<p>Formal Definition</p> <p>An ITS architecture is the conceptual design that defines the structure and/or behaviour of an integrated Intelligent Transport System (ITS).</p> <p>An architecture description is a formal description of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structural properties of the system.

This flow can be speeded up significantly if the systems are integrated, i.e. if data is exchanged automatically between motorway and city control centres, if the information is available to public transport operators and users as well as to private car drivers, and can be sent to message panels, on-board vehicle systems, mobile phones, web-based transport informations services, etc.</p> <p>In this example, system integration can make it possible not only to minimise travel disruption, but also to save lives.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/tool/","title":"FRAME Architecture Tool","text":""},{"location":"getting-started/tool/#use-of-the-frame-tool","title":"Use of the FRAME Tool","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>The tool is the Enterprise Architect, in the text below we describe it use with FRAME.</p> <p>TODO</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/tool/#use-of-the-frame-selection-tool","title":"Use of the FRAME Selection Tool","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>This custom tool was used with FRAME Architecture version 4.</p> <p>The Tool does not perform any selections automatically, but it does support the architecture team in its use of the methodology in the following ways.</p> <ul> <li>The team selects those User Needs that reflect the Stakeholder Aspirations.</li> <li>The tool will then guide the architecture team to those parts of the Functional View that help to satisfy those User Needs.</li> <li>The FRAME Architecture does not claim to satisfy every possible ITS User Need, and in some circumstances it may be necessary to add extra User Needs and Functional View elements to the Selection Tool data base.</li> <li>Since the mapping from User Needs to Functions is not an exact science, the tool will probably report some logical inconsistencies after the first pass (e.g. a data flow with only the function at one end selected).

The alternative term of \u201cArchitecture\u201d is still used elsewhere, but we feel that an architecture made up of views is more comprehensible than one that is made up of architectures.</p> <p>A Functional View (sometimes called a Logical View) shows the functionality that will be required to fulfil the User Needs, and hence the Stakeholder Aspirations. When using the FRAME Architecture the Functional View is shown as Data Flow Diagrams that contain functions, data stores and terminators, and the data that flows between them.

This shows the ITS as a single item and the links needed by the functionality contained within it to communicate with the entities outside it. It is useful for two reasons. Firstly it enables the system boundary to be defined showing what is inside the ITS and what is not, and thus what is the responsibility of the ITS Engineers (and hence what its not!). Secondly it enables definitions to be produced of the way in which the functionality inside the ITS expects the outside entities to behave.

Those that pass between sub-systems or  modules make up the Physical Data Flows, and represent a communication  channel between sub-systems, and/or between modules.</p> <p>Since sub-systems are, by definition, located in different places  (e.g. in a traffic management centre, at the road side, in a vehicle) it  is possible to produce communications specifications by analysing the  contents of each Physical Data Flow.
